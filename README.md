📊 Data Analysis with Apache Spark – Microsoft Learn Lab

This project was completed as part of the “Analyze data in a data lake with Apache Spark” lab on the Microsoft Learn platform. The main goal of the lab is to gain hands-on experience with Apache Spark in the Azure Synapse Analytics environment to perform data analysis tasks.

🔍 Objective

Through this lab, I learned how to:

Create an Apache Spark pool,

Read CSV files from a Data Lake,

Work with Spark DataFrames,

Define schemas and query data using Spark SQL,

Visualize data using Matplotlib.


🛠️ Steps Completed

Spark Pool Configuration
A new Spark pool was created in Azure Synapse.


Reading Data

The customer-data.csv file stored in Azure Data Lake was read.


Schema Definition

A manual schema was defined and used to read the data.


Spark SQL Querying

The DataFrame was registered as a temporary view, and queries were executed using Spark SQL.


Data Visualization

Basic charts were created using the matplotlib library.


📁 Files and Screenshots

The following screenshots were captured during the lab:

Spark pool configuration

Data reading and analysis outputs

Spark SQL query results

Example data visualizations

These images are stored in the images/ folder in the GitHub repository.
